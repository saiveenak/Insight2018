# Donation Analytics Insight Coding Challenge 2018

In this project, using a file listing individual campaign contributions for multiple years, I determine which ones came from repeat donors, calculate a few values and distill the results into a single output file, repeat_donors.txt.
For each recipient, zip code and calendar year, calculated these three values for contributions coming from repeat donors:

* total dollars received
* total number of contributions received
* donation amount in a given percentile (30th)
* Getting Started

Run the shell script  using  ./run.sh


* Libraries required:

    * Mainly used Python 3 to develop the code and packages - os,collection and sys. (used PyCharm IDE)

* Tests

    * The project follows exact file structure as mentioned in the challenge summary.
